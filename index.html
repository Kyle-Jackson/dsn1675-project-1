<p>I am currently studying Graphic Design in the School of Media and Design at Algonquin College. I am currently in my second year of the three year program and I will keep on learning more valuable skills and techniques along the way. I have a wide range of skills and I also have experience with design software such as the Adobe Creative Suite. I am also a creative thinker who is able to solve problems with new, innovative ideas.</p>
<p>Some of my favourite parts of Graphic Design are logo design, illustration, and photography. I am also a big fan of sports so after I graduate from Algonquin College I would ideally like to get a job in the Graphic Design side of the sports industry.</p>
